        <i>A winter garden in an alder swamp,<br>
        Where conies now come out to sun and romp,<br>
        As near a paradise as it can be<br>
        And not melt snow or start a dormant tree.<br>

        It lifts existence on a plane of snow<br>
        One level higher than the earth below,<br>
        One level nearer heaven overhead,<br>
        And last year's berries shining scarlet red.<br>

        It lifts a gaunt luxuriating beast<br>
        Where he can stretch and hold his highest feat<br>
        On some wild apple tree's young tender bark,<br>
        What well may prove the year's high girdle mark.<br>

        So near to paradise all pairing ends:<br>
        Here loveless birds now flock as winter friends,<br>
        Content with bud-inspecting. They presume<br>
        To say which buds are leaf and which are bloom.<br>

        A feather-hammer gives a double knock.<br>
        This Eden day is done at two o'clock.<br>
        An hour of winter day might seem too short<br>
        To make it worth life's while to wake and sport.<br></i>
