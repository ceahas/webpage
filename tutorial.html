            <h2>LOGGING INTO GITHUB</h2>
                    <p>
                        Go to <a href="https://github.com/login">the github</a> login page and enter your username and password.<br>
                        Once there, click on the link labelled "ceahas/webpage" on the top right corner as shown here:<br>
                        <img src="tutorial/step1.jpg"><br>
                        After clicking on that link, you'll be presented with a page that looks like this:<br>
                        <img src="tutorial/step1a.jpg"><br>
                        This is the folder that will hold your website. All webpages and images will be added here.<br>
                        <b>index.html</b> will be your homepage. This is the first page people will see when they visit your site. If you only want one scrolling
                        page, you can just keep editing this one.
                    </p>
            <h2>MODIFYING A PREXISTING PAGE</h2>
                    <p>
                        Let's start by setting up your <b>index.html</b> page, it's not too difficult!<br>
                        Click on "index.html" on the page we were looking at earlier:<br>
                        <img src="tutorial/step2.jpg"><br>
                        This will bring us to a page that looks like this. We need to press the <i>edit</i> button:<br>
                        <img src="tutorial/step2a.jpg"><br>
                        This will open up the editor window. Here you'll see the HTML code of the webpage:<br>
                        <img src="tutorial/step2b.jpg"><br>
                        Don't panic! The only things you need to change are the actual text content of the page. You can simply remove and change the text between
                        html tags. For example:<br>
                        <img src="turorial/step2c.jpg"><br>
                        As you can see, we kept the title tag intact and changed the text between the tags.<br>
                        <br>
                        Things aren't as complicated as they might seem. I've already preconfigured the site with easy to use templates. The only thing you will
                        need to worry about is everything between the <i>body</i> tag. Here are the main things you will need to edit:<br>
                        <img src="tutorial/step2d.jpg"><br>
                        When you've edited your page and you want to save it, click on the <i>commit changes</i> button on the bottom of the screen. Don't worry about
                        any of the other fields. Your page should now update when you refresh it, you may need to wait a few minutes for the changes to appear.<br>

            <h2>CREATING A NEW PAGE</h2>
                    <p>
                        So what if you need to make a new page? It's pretty easy to do! If you're not already on the folder with all your your files as shown in
                        the "logging into github" instructions, click on the "webpage" link on the top right corner of the screen as shown here:<br>
                        <img src="tutorial/step3.jpg"><br>
                        Click on the template.html file and simply copy the text as shown here:<br>
                        <img src="tutorial/step3a.jpg"><br>
                        Go back to your webpage folder and select the add file button, from the drop down menu, select create new file:<br>
                        <img src="tutorial/step3b.jpg"><br>
                        Name your file whatever you'd like to name it. Make sure it ends in .html. Paste the text you copied from the template as shown here:<br>
                        <img src="tutorial/step3c.jpg"><br>
                        Edit the header, subheaders and paragraphs as you see fit. <b>Make sure to commit changes before leaving the page or you will
                        lose everything you've done.</b>
                        <i>There's a file in your main folder called example.html, this will show you the various other things you can do with your page. Please
                            feel free to ask me if you want some specific instructions on how to do certain things (e.g. add an image)</i><br>
                        Now that you have your new page, you might want to link to it from your home page. For this you'll need a hyperlink. On your index.html file,
                        add the following code whever you'd like:<br>
                        <img src="tutorial/step3d.jpg"><br>
                    </p>
            <h2>CHANGING THE FONT, COLOR OR ALIGNMENT OF YOUR PAGE</h2>
                    <p>
                        If you'd like to change the style of your page, you'll need to edit the file "style.css." You'll edit this just like you would an html file.<br>
                        <img src="tutorial/step4.jpg"><br>
                        Now simply edit the <i>coloured</i> text here:<br>
                        <img src="tutorial/step4a.jpg"><br>
                        For example, we could change the background-color from white to black. We just need to make sure the ; is intact.<br>
                        Once you're done, make sure to commit changes.<br>
                        This will change the colours and fonts on <b>all</b> of your webpages on github. If you want to change the colours on a specific page,
                        you can try to follow the instructions on the style.css document or ask me for help.<br>
                        There are comments in the style.css document (denoted by /* and darker grey text) that will explain what each option does.<br>
                    </p>
            <h2>UPLOADING AN IMAGE TO YOUR PAGE</h2>
                    <p>
                        If you decide that you'd like to add an image to you page, you'll first need to upload it. You can do so like this:<br>
                        <img src="tutorial/step5.jpg"><br>
                        Drag and drop your image(s) into the box on the next page, and make sure to commit your changes.<br>
                        On the page that you'd like to add your image, use the following html code:<br>
                        &lt;img src="image.jpg"&gt;&lt;br&gt;<br>
                        Remember to replace <i>image.jpg</i> with the name of your image.
                    </p>
            <h2>OTHER USEFUL CODE</h2>
                    <p>
                        <b>hyperlink</b>
                        &lt;a href="pagename.html"&gt;Link Text&lt;/a&gt;<br>

                        <b>center text:</b>
                        &lt;center&gt;text&lt;/center&gt;
